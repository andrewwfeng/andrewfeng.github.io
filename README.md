<p align="center">WARNING! I have no experience or education in coding, so this page is very much an experiment for me! Sorry in advance to all the experienced coders reading this haha :)</p>
<p align="center">But, of course, I am always open to hearing suggestions though! My contact info is located at the bottom of this page!!</p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
Hello! My name is Andrew Feng, but I also go by Wei (Weixuan is my Chinese name!). I am currently in my third-year of my undergraduate studies, pursuing a double major in political science and criminology & socio-legal studies at the University of Toronto, St. George Campus. 
<br>
<br>
My goal right now is to make it to a Canadian Law School, preferably UofT. I am studying hard right now my LSAT, which I will take in August.

   <summary><h4>Why did I make this page?</h4></summary>
I have always wanted to take up coding as a hobby, so I guess this is a start for me! I hope that this site is sufficient in documenting who I am, and what I have been up to.

  <summary><h4>My Academic Interests</h4></summary>
In political science, my primary research interest is Canadian federal politics. This includes topics such as federalism, constitutional law, Quebec nationalism, and Indigenous law. Speaking of Indigenous law, I am deeply interested in Indigenous sovereignty politics, both in  Canada and beyond (especially in Hawai'i)!
<br>
<br>
In criminology, my primary research interest is the penology.
